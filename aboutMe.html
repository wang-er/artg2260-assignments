					<p>Hi! I'm Erin Wang and I'm a first year Computer Science and Design major.
						I'm taking this course (along with this entire major) because I've been always interested in
						helping improve our experiences on the web. I've wanted to try out designing websites, but this 
						is my first time taking a course specifically about it. I'm excited, but also a bit nervous because 
						I've never really done anything except for a little bit of HTML and CSS.  
						<br>
						<br>
						Other than that, I absolutely love playing games of all sorts. Card games, board games, video games, all of them. 
						In fact, I'm currently on E-Board for Northeastern's board game club (NUAGE, come visit us!). If I had to pick a genre of games however,
						my favorite would be rhythm games. I love listening to music and being able to "interact" with it at the same time.  Other things I like doing 
						is doodling, figuring out escape rooms, sleeping, and chilling with friends.
